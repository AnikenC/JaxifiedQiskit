# Jaxifying Qiskit Dynamics

This repository aims to use jax to accelerate qiskit dynamics, qiskit pulse, and qiskit runtime, in conjunction to produce incredibly fast hamiltonian simulations. This reduces simulations for one to three qubit systems by orders of magnitude, allowing for millisecond level simulation of statevector and density matrix evolutions.
